# cloud-connector

I developed a python connector that transforms data from a cloud based SAAS service (monday.com) into a format that can be utilized by the business analytics software, Microsoft Power BI. A deeper understanding of actionable insights was developed through the analysis of data, development of metrics, and creating reports in Microsoft Power BI.

A high proficiency in python and JSON data structures was required in order for the Microsoft Power BI python connector to be successfully completed. From a technical perspective, the python connector calls REST web services to consume JSON data from the monday.com. The data is then transformed into a format that will enable the analysis of Monday.com board data to be performed in Microsoft power BI. Dynamically analyzing changes in the source data structure (such as new columns in monday.com boards) and factoring these changes automatically during data transformation was one of the key capabilities of the connector.

This whole process required a strong level of analytical and communication skills and this was demonstrated through the documentation, of the python connector.

#### Softwares/tools that assisted in development

I used SoapUI (an open source API testing tool) to analyze the Monday.com webservices
