# cloud-connector

I created a python connector which parsed (converted) data from the cloud based SAAS service (monday.com) into a format that can be utlized by Microsoft Power BI. 

#### Softwares/tools that assisted in development

I used SoapUI (an open source API testing tool) to analyze the Monday.com webservices
